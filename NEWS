=============

Version: 0.8.1 [2015-10-24]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Importing core R functions.


Version: 0.8.0 [2015-02-23]

BUG FIXES:

 o plot() for SnpNmfFit used undefined variable 'fit'.

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o ROBUSTNESS: Package test coverage is 49%.



Version: 0.7.1 [2014-04-27]

DOCUMENTATION:

 o Rebuilt help pages which drop references to a

 o Clarified the example(fitSnpNmfArray).

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Added package system tests.

 o Bumped package dependencies.


Version: 0.7.0 [2013-10-17]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Now importing only what needs to be imported and
  formally declaring all S3 methods in NAMESPACE.

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added argument 'drop' to doACNE() to be more consistent with
  similar methods in aroma.affymetrix, e.g. doRMA() and doCRMAv2().
  
DOCUMENTATION:

 o Added a help page for doACNE().
 o Added references to ACNE article.

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o CLEANUP: Removed all explicit calls to gc() and replaced all
  rm() with faster NULL assignments.

 o Bumped the package dependencies.
 o Package now requires R (>= 2.15.0) [and Bioc (>= 2.10.0)].


Version: 0.6.2 [2013-09-16]

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Bumped the package dependencies.


Version: 0.6.1 [2013-08-23]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Now formally declaring S3 methods in NAMESPACE.


Version: 0.6.0 [2013-08-21]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Now package no longer attaches ("loads") several of the
  dependent packages, e.g. R.methods, R.oo, matrixStats, MASS.

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Added .Rbuildignore to package so that incl/ and other
  directories/files are not included in the source build.

 o Bumped the package dependencies.


Version: 0.5.1 [2012-10-16]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Now package imports utils, R.methodsS3 and R.oo.

BUG FIXES:

 o No longer passing '...' to NextMethod(), cf.
  R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it
  for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.


Version: 0.5.0 [2011-10-24]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Added a NAMESPACE.


Version: 0.4.3 [2011-08-01]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o WORKAROUND: In order for the package to work with the most recent
  version of R devel, which automatically add namespaces to packages
  who do not have one, we explicitly have specify that this package
  should use, for instance, cat() of R.utils (instead of 'base').


Version: 0.4.2 [2010-09-28]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Improved validation of argument 'refs'.


Version: 0.4.1 [2010-06-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added argument 'refs' to NmfPlm() and fitSnpNmf().

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Added more biocViews to the DESCRIPTION file.


Version: 0.4.0 [2010-05-18]

BUG FIXES:

 o The NmfSnp class would use a way too large threshold
  for deciding when the NMF algorithm has converged.  The
  default accuracy 0.02 was replaced with 10.0 due to a "stray"
  argument in an internal function call.  This bug has been there
  since March 24, 2009.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 o All flavors of NMF algorithms but the default one
  ("v4") is deprecated and no longer available in NmfPlm.


Version: 0.3.0 [2010-05-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added doACNE().  Added also redundancy tests for it.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 o Now a flavor tag is added to NmfPlm:s only
  if flavor != "v4" (default).


Version: 0.2.0 [2010-05-04]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 o Set the license to LGPL v2.1 or newer.

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Bumped up the version of the package dependencies.



Version: 0.1.2 [2009-11-18]

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o For debug purposes, the internal NmfPlm
  fit function as well as fitSnpNmf() used to save the input
  data for each SNP fitted.  This is now removed, and should
  speed up the processing substantially.


Version: 0.1.1 [2009-11-11]

MISCELLANEOUS:

 o Removed an obsolete testScripts/.

BUG FIXES:

 o One of the testScripts/ had a type.


Version: 0.1.0 [2009-11-03]

Version: 0.0.5 [2009-03-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 o Added fitSnpNmfArray(), which takes an Kx2xI array.
  fitSnpNmfArray() returns a list object of class SnpNmfFit
  for which there is a plot() function.
  Note, fitSnpNmf() takes a 2KxI matrix.
  
 o Added snpMatrixToArray() and snpArrayToMatrix().

DOCUMENTATION:

 o Added example code with example data for fitSnpNmfArray().


Version: 0.0.4 [2009-03-24]
